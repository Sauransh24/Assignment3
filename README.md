## Abstract
This project explores the design and implementation of a stock market analysis tool in Java, focusing on the underlying data structure used for efficient analysis of stock performance. Addressing the need for robust stock market analysis tools, I evaluate various data structures, including arrays, linked lists, and heaps, considering factors such as insertion, removal, and heapify operations. Ultimately, I opt for a max heap data structure, highlighting its advantages in prioritizing stocks based on criteria such as price movements and trading volume. The provided Java code implements this max heap as a generic class and showcases its versatility for analyzing stock data. Additionally, I present a real-world use case for our stock market analysis tool, illustrating its application in identifying top-performing stocks for investment portfolios. Finally, I conduct a performance benchmark, comparing the efficiency of our max heap implementation with other priority queue implementations. The results demonstrate the competitive performance of our max heap data structure for stock market analysis tasks, making it a suitable choice for investors and analysts alike.

## Background
The stock market is a complex system where the performance of individual stocks can be influenced by various factors such as market trends, company earnings reports, and geopolitical events. Analyzing stock performance requires efficient data structures and algorithms to handle large datasets and perform operations like sorting and prioritization quickly.

## Design Decisions
The decision to use a max heap data structure for stock market analysis was based on its ability to efficiently handle operations like insertion, removal, and heapify, which are essential for analyzing stock performance. Max heaps are particularly useful for identifying top-performing stocks based on criteria such as price movements or trading volume.

### Benefits:
- **Efficient Insertion and Removal**: Max heaps offer logarithmic time complexity for insertion and removal operations, making them suitable for dynamic datasets where stocks are frequently added or removed.
- **Priority Queue Operations**: Max heaps can be used as priority queues to prioritize stocks based on certain criteria, such as market capitalization or price-to-earnings ratio.
- **Heapify Efficiency**: The heapify operation, which maintains the heap property after inserting or removing elements, can be performed in linear time, ensuring efficient updates to the heap structure.
- **Identification of Top-Performing Stocks**: Max heaps excel at identifying top-performing stocks by allowing quick access to the maximum element. This capability is particularly valuable for investors and analysts seeking to identify lucrative investment opportunities or monitor the performance of high-performing stocks in real-time.

## Code Design
The project consists of a Java implementation of a max heap data structure and a performance testing script to benchmark its operations.

### Main Classes:
- **Heap**: This interface defines the basic structure and behavior of a heap data structure.
- **MaxHeap**: This class extends the Heap class and implements the max heap data structure.
- **StockMarketAnalysisToolImpl**: Class implementing the StockMarketAnalysisTool interface and utilizing the MaxHeap and RealTimeDataProvider to perform stock market analysis.
- **Stock**: Class representing a stock object with methods for calculating market cap and change in value.
- **HeapPerformanceTest**: Class used for benchmarking heap operations.

### AlphaVantageDataProvider:
The stock market tool gets real-time stock info from the Alpha Vantage API. It sends an HTTP request to Alpha Vantage with the stock symbol and API key. Alpha Vantage processes the request and sends back stock data in JSON format. The tool then reads this data to find the current price, volume, and other important details. After that, it creates a Stock object with this info, including the stock symbol, price, and volume. This integration with Alpha Vantage lets users get the latest stock info for different symbols, helping them analyze and make smart investment choices based on real-time data.

## Use Cases
### Use Case 1: Stock Performance Analysis
The max heap data structure can be used to prioritize stocks based on criteria such as price movements, trading volume, or market capitalization. Analysts can use the heap to quickly identify top-performing stocks or stocks with significant price fluctuations for further analysis.

### Use Case 2: Portfolio Management
Investors can use max heaps to manage their investment portfolios by prioritizing stocks based on their risk-return profiles or investment objectives. The heap can help investors rebalance their portfolios by identifying underperforming or overperforming stocks that may need adjustment.

## Performance Benchmark
The performance testing script HeapPerformanceTest.java implements three main tests:
1. Insertion Benchmark: Measures the time taken to insert stock data into the max heap.
2. Removal Benchmark: Measures the time taken to remove stocks from the max heap.
3. Heapify Benchmark: Measures the time taken to heapify an array of stock data.

In addition to performance benchmarking, the project includes analysis of the following aspects:
- Stock Market Data
- Heapify Logic

## Conclusion
In summary, the benchmark results show that heapify is exceptionally efficient, insertion scales
